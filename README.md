## RescueBot 

A project, written in Java, utilising the leJOS API to create a maze-navigating robot.

RescueBot will use live DFS to navigate a physical maze; placing its own nodes and actively tracking its position in the maze. Once physically rescuing the target, RescueBot will backtrack using its node structure to exit the maze.
