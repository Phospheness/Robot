We wrote an indepth breakdown of our project  (Jae on google docs)and brokedown our problem
We decided that a cardboard maze would be too large and impractical to run tests on, so we decided to  make a line maze. The issue with this was that the robot would not be able to see a side path if it 
was going along a straight line. To  solve this, Jae first suggested having the light sensor rotate, as we were using the light sensor to have the robot follow a line. This had an issue where the wires would
tangle up. Dhara came up  with a solution to make it rotate back and forth at 200 degrees (180 with 10 degree boundaries). 
This raised our next issue of not being able to differentiate two seperate paths from one another.
